## The Challenges
Initially working on Ubuntu Windows 11 with WSL2 does not support audio and microphone. Tried on different systems to test run the project.

**VirtualBox-Ubuntu 22.04**: 

Taking too much space of computer and slow down the computer.

**Wondows 11**:  

Works fine, but consider future project, prefer Linux.

**Kali Linux**: 

Worked fine, but not stable, sometimes not working.
